           <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-4">
           I designed a website with a classmate earlier in my design career for my Intro to Web Design class; we were given a task to create a company and its branding, as well as its website. We were given different categories to choose, and I chose Charity/Donation website. I wasn’t as exposed to UX practices as I am now. I wanted to go back into this project and redesign and update it, reflecting on bad UX practices that were implanted and seeing what can be improved upon. I believe self reflection is important as well as gauging your skillsets.
            <br><br>
           The goal was to <b>inform with empathy and motivate others to contribute to the cause.</b>

      </p>
         
          <h3 style="padding: 0px; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-2">Initial Evaluations</h3>
    
           <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-4">
          <b>a. Color Contrast </b> 
                <br>
            There isn’t enough. It is hard to see some of the text, especially with a background that doesn’t serve as a strong contrast. 
            <br>
           <b>b. Type size and weight</b>
            <br>
            This is especially true in mobile, but the type size is way too small and gets easily lost in a lot of information. 
            <br>
            <b>c. Missing information when mobile</b>
            <br>
            This was another big issue. Users do not like to feel like that they are missing content and information. I needed to redesign the site so it adapts better to mobile while retaining all the information in desktop.
      </p>
        
    
        <h3 style="padding: 0px; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-2">Usability Test</h3>
    
           <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-4">
           In order to test the usability of the site, I listed some tasks for the participants to complete: <br><br>

            <b>1. Someone told you about the organization and you want to find more about their mission.</b><br>

           <b>2. You want to donate to the cause but also want to know how you’re contributing.</b> <br>

            <b>3. You want to find out where you can read relevant updates/news about the cause.</b><br><br>

            I then organized the painpoints in an affinity map.
      </p>
       
       <div class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">
                       <img src="img/affinitymap.jpg">
            </div>
            
    
       <h3 style="padding: 0px; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-2">Insights</h3>
    
           <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-4">
           This exercise gave more clarity on the specific painpoints experienced by users. Things that came up frequently during the usability tests were: <br><br>

           <b>1. Most people had a hard time reading certain texts. This was especially true in mobile.</b><br> 

            <b>2. Most people did not know you had to scroll down or that it was even an option.</b> <br>

            <b>3. Users wanted to know where there money was going specifically and how they are contributing. They were also unsure of the currency of their donation. </b><br><br>
            
            I decided to prioritize these three pain points since they came up more frequently than others. 

      </p>
      
        <h3 style="padding: 0px; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-2">Initial Wireframes</h3>
      
    <div class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">

        <h3 style="padding: 0px; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-3">Mockups</h3>
           
        <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto;" class="mb-4">
           I then created mockups, showing the before and after. I annotated initial problems that were pointed out by users in the  before and added notes about my design solutions in the after.

           <p style="color: white; width: 75%; margin: auto; padding-bottom: 20px;">
          
          To sum things up, I focused on three pain points and designed solutions to each one.<br><br>
          
          <i>1. Users found it hard to read the content. This was especially true in mobile.</i><br>
            
                <b>Solution:</b> Optimize color contrast and remove unnecessary clutter. Choose appropriate typefaces and font-sizes that will allow users to easily read the content without having to zoom in.<br><br>

            <i>2. Most users did not know you had to scroll down on some pages, most frequently, the donation page.</i> <br>
            
             <b>Solution:</b> Hint to users that there is important content beneat the header images. A good way to do that is to not occupy the whole screen with just static image.  <br><br>

            <i>3. Users wanted to know specifically where there money was going and the accepted currency. </i><br>
            
            <b>Solution:</b> Inform users on the currency used. In addition, I added a box that informs users how their contribution will be used. <br><br>
            
            I believe that these changes will give a more pleasurable user experience and will eliminate a lot of confusion. It was good to reflect on an earlier project and test my capabilities as a designer today.
